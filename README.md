# Unofficial Armbian build for Makerbase [MKS PI](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-PI) and [MKS SKIPR](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-SKIPR) and few more boards

TLTR: Unofficial support of Makerbase MKS PI and MKS SKIPR and other boards. Contains `mkspi` board declaration and related kernel and u-boot patches.  
Please note, result Armbian image is not full replacement for mks distributed image. You have to do yourself all OS configuration and and Klipper components installation.  

**WIP, absolutely no guarantees, you do everything at your own risk.**  



## Bit of Liric

The MKS-PI ads look good, especially considering the price and the display (e.g. the size fits the Ghost Flying Bear printer). However, the software and support from the manufacturer is terrible.   

There is no source code (yeah, GPL license, of course), no answer to questions, etc. They provide preconfigured Armbian+Klipper, but the image contains random/outdated components and I have problems with WIFI adapters. And who knows what else is hidden in there.    

So the idea was to build a normal Armbian image using the available information (provided patches, circuitry and information from the native image).   


## Goals

Make Armbian build with `current` and `edge` kernels.     

Please note:
* Klipper, Fluid, and other related components are out of scope of this repo, please refer https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh if you have interest in these topics.
* original patches were taken from Makerbase repositoy https://github.com/makerbase-mks/armbian-build, this means you have to be mentally ready to see ~~this mess~~ "fast and dirty" approach. I do not have enought knowlage and time to orgonise this mess in right way. 
If you know proper way how to orgonise these patches and right places in armbian sources for them, you are welcome to discussions or just open PRs.
* I do not have access to full MKS PI set and cannot test all features. Main goal is to have worked following component:
  * booting from micro SD
  * MKSPI-TS35 TFT display (better with working touch screen :) )
  * HDMI output
  * USB ports, including USB 3 port
  * ADXL345 (SPI bus)
* If you are interested in UART, I2C, EMMC etc features, feel free to step into development/testing or support by hardware.
* ~~Currently I am focusing only on Ubuntu LTS builds (`current` and `edge` kernels). Feel free to open PRs if you would need non LTS Ubuntu or Debian images.~~ Currently Ubuntu LTS (tested) and Debian Bullseye (non tested) builds are supported.


## Current status

Supported boards:
* [MKS PI](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-PI) - fully supported
* [MKS SKIPR](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-SKIPR) - fully supported
* QIDI X-4 and X-6 Mainboards (made by MKS for X-Plus 3 and X-Max 3) - partially supported. See [FreeQIDI](https://openqidi.com/books/build-entire-operating-system-and-klipper-from-scratch/page/freeqidi) and https://github.com/redrathnure/armbian-mkspi/issues/21 for more details.

MKS IPS50 LCD - works starting from `0.3.1-24.2.0-trunk` version.

A `build-essential` and kernel header packages are preinstalled starting from `0.3.2-24.2.0-trunk` version. It should simplify Klipper installation and building custom kernel modules (e.g. WIFI modules like [RTL8188GU (RTL8710B)](https://github.com/McMCCRU/rtl8188gu) one).

Images should be ready for a daily usage. Everything seem to be workes, however please pay attantion:

1. Only Ubuntu builds are actively tested (use Debian ones for your own risk)
2. Some bugs may appear from time to time. Especially it related to edge builds (based on edge 6.x kernel). Please check [release page](https://github.com/redrathnure/armbian-mkspi/releases) for more details.


### ADXL345/SPI Usage

TLTR: Do not forget about [klipper_mcu installation](https://www.klipper3d.org/RPi_microcontroller.html).

Full version:

* Step 0: Ensure spidev device exists. e.g. `ls -al /dev/spi*` should show `/dev/spidev0.2` device file
* Step 1: Install Klipper. E.g. 
	```
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh.git
	./kiauh/kiauh.sh
	```
	,  then 1, 1, 1 and so on.
* Step 2: Build and install `klipper_mcu` service
	```
	# Build and install klipper_mcu binary
	cd ~/klipper/
	
	# In the menu, set "Microcontroller Architecture" to "Linux process," then save and exit.
	make menuconfig
	
	# Preapre klipper-mcu service 
	sudo ln -s $PWD/scripts/klipper-mcu.service /etc/systemd/system/
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable klipper-mcu.service

	# Stop klipper service and install klipper-mcu binary file
	sudo service klipper stop
	make flash

	# Start klipper_mcu and klipper
	sudo systemctl start klipper-mcu klipper-mcu
	
	# Ensure everything is up and running
	sudo systemctl status klipper-mcu klipper
	```
* Step 3: [Add adxl345 configuration to your `printer.cfg`](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-PI#adxl345-connection-and-configuration)


### Package Updates via Apt Update

Please double check kernel packages were freezed before running `apt update` command. E.g. run `sudo armbian-config` and check `System` -> `Freeze - Disable Armbian kernel updates` item.


### How to Rotate Screen

Sometimes you need to rotate the image on the screen, for example, when upgrading Flying Bear Ghost 5 printer. To do this you need to change value for `rotate` parameter under `spi_for_lcd@0` section (configuration for the display) and use `touchscreen-inverted-x = <0x01>` and/or `touchscreen-inverted-y = <0x01>` parameters for `spi_for_touch@1` section (configuration for touchscreen) in `/boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dtb` file. Please note, value for `touchscreen-inverted-x = <0x01>` or `touchscreen-inverted-y = <0x01>` does *not* affect anything. To disable e.g. y-inversion, whole parameter should be commented out (`# touchscreen-inverted-y = <0x01>;`). There are few examples:

* 270° (default mode) - `rotate = <270>;` (or `rotate = <0x10e>;` and `touchscreen-inverted-y = <0x01>`
* 90° (flipped horizontally) - `rotate = <90>;` and `touchscreen-inverted-x = <0x01>`

Following commands may be used to perform this configuration:
```
# Backup
sudo cp /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dtb /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dtb.$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S").bak
# Unpack DTB file
sudo dtc -I dtb -O dts -o rk3328-roc-cc.dts /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dtb
#Make a copy to work with
sudo cp rk3328-roc-cc.dts rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts

# Find `rotate = <SOME_VALUE>` and change to `rotate = <NEW_VALUE>`, where NEW_VALUE is a rotation angle, e.g. `rotate = <90>` or `rotate = <270>`
# Then find `touchscreen-inverted-y` attribute and add or replace `touchscreen-inverted-x` one
nano rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts

# Or sed -i -e "s/<0x10e>/<90>/g" rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts
# and sed -i -e "s/touchscreen-inverted-y/touchscreen-inverted-x/g" rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts

# Double check
less rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts | grep rotate
less rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts | grep touchscreen-inverted

# Pack DTS to DTB
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dtb rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dts

# Update rk3328-roc-cc.dtb with new version
sudo cp rk3328-roc-cc-rotated.dtb /boot/dtb/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dtb

# Reboot
sudo reboot
```


## How to Build

The new `mkspi` board was declared. Now has support only for `current` and `edge` kernels and Ubuntu Jammy OS (CLI and desktop editions). Build process is pretty usual for Armbain build.


I would advice to read official documentation, however it's short version:

1. Use Ubunut Jammy 22.04 OS (or VM). Ensure you have 15-40GB of free disk and 4-6GB RAM.
2. Clone repo
3. `cd armbian-mkspi`
4. `./compile.sh` and follow instructions... Please do not forget about `BSPFREEZE=yes` build arg (or freezing kernel updates via `sudo armbian-config` right after the first login). A few ready to use commands:
  * Ubuntu Jammy with current kernel:    `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=current RELEASE=jammy    BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * Ubuntu Jammy with edge kernel:       `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=edge    RELEASE=jammy    BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * Debian bullseye with current kernel: `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=current RELEASE=bullseye BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * Debian bullseye with edge kernel:    `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=edge    RELEASE=bullseye BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * Debian bookworm with current kernel: `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=current RELEASE=bookworm BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * Debian bookworm with edge kernel:    `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=edge    RELEASE=bookworm BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img`
  * append `INSTALL_HEADERS=yes BUILD_KSRC=yes INSTALL_KSRC=yes` and `BSFREEZE=yes` flags if you will need kernel headers, e.g. to compile custom WiFi drivers
  * if you need to modify the kernel sources: `./compile.sh  BOARD=mkspi BRANCH=current RELEASE=jammy BSPFREEZE=yes BUILD_DESKTOP=no BUILD_MINIMAL=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img kernel-patch`
5. Wait a 20-180 minutes (depends of your hardware, mostly disk system) and check `output\images\` directory

https://github.com/makerbase-mks/armbian-build repo contains random crap (half worked patches for legacy 4.4 Kernel and non full armbian integration)

In generally it's not clear what was changed, however looks like MKS guys were not too creative and almost copy rockchip64/Renegade board. Patches include:
1. Changes for `/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3328-roc-cc.dts` ( redeclaring a few pins, disabling some features and declaring new ones. mostly for MKSPI-TS35 screen)
2. HDMI interface change, seems just to declare mode with 5:3 aspect ration
3. "Patch" for `fbtft/fb_ili9341` driver. Basically redefining screen resolution.
4. patches for SPI support code. 
5. Changes to drm_edid (see `/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid.c` and `/drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/inno_hdmi.c` files). However I have no idea what this about and how to apply this patches to new kernel sources.
6. Kernel v4.4 config. However I am not sure how it's relevant to the current and edge branches.

## What does this project do?

- Builds custom **kernel**, **image** or a **distribution** optimized for low-resource hardware,
- Include filesystem generation, low-level control software, kernel image and **bootloader** compilation,
- Provides a **consistent user experience** by keeping system standards across different platforms.

## Getting started

### Requirements for self hosted

- x86_64 / aarch64 machine
- at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for VM, container or bare metal installation
- [Armbian / Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x](https://github.com/armbian/sdk) for native building or any Docker capable Linux for containerised
- Windows 10/11 with WSL2 subsystem running Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x
- Superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).
- Make sure your system is up-to-date! Outdated Docker binaries, for example, can cause trouble.

For stable branch use `--branch=v23.11`

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main https://github.com/armbian/build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

<a href="#how-to-build-an-image-or-a-kernel"><img src=".github/README.gif" alt="Armbian logo" width="100%"></a>

- Interactive graphical interface.
- Prepares the workspace by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process and creates a kernel package or a ready-to-use SD card image.
